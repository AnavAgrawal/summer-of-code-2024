# Sales Forecasting Report

## Introduction

This report outlines the approach and results of the sales forecasting task performed using a dataset of sales records. The goal was to predict future sales based on historical data to aid in better inventory and resource management.

## Approach

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
    - **Dataset**: The sales dataset was loaded and initial exploration was conducted to understand its structure.
    - **Date Processing**: 
        - The `Order Date` column was converted to datetime format.
        - Sales data was aggregated by date to get daily total sales.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - The unique values in categorical columns were identified.
    - A line plot of sales over time was generated to visualize trends and patterns in the sales data.

3. **Data Preparation for Forecasting**:
    - The sales data was formatted for use with the Prophet forecasting model:
        - Columns were renamed appropriately (`Order Date` to `ds` and `Sales` to `y`).
        - The data was sorted by date and the index was reset.
    
4. **Forecasting Model**:
    - The `neuralprophet` library was installed and used for forecasting future sales.
    - The model was trained on the preprocessed sales data.

## Results

- The dataset was successfully preprocessed, and sales data was aggregated by date.
- The line plot of sales over time provided insights into the sales trends, showing peaks and troughs that could be useful for forecasting.
- The Prophet model was prepared and trained on the dataset, enabling the prediction of future sales based on historical data.

## Conclusion

The sales forecasting task demonstrated the utility of time series analysis and forecasting models in predicting future sales trends. These predictions can be instrumental in making informed business decisions related to inventory and resource planning.
